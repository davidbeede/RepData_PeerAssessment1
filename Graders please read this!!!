Please scroll past the junk at the top of my markdown file (i.e., past the RHistory and other stuff). Then you'll see the
actual markdown file and charts.  Please try patiently to look for my submission materials and not give up too soon.
I found it very complicated and difficult to commit and push my files properly.  I worked very hard on the actual
project and hope that mistakes in submission won't cost me too many points.  Thank you for your attention!  David
